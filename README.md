This is the repository for my MSc Software Development Final Project - 2134403S

If you have downloaded this Zip from Moodle, there are likely some modules missing. This is because the node_modules folders had to be removed from the folder, as these made the folder too large to upload.

In total, there are three "node_modules" folders that will be missing:
1) my-app -> node_modules
2) api -> node_modules
3) api -> trackerhunt -> node_modules.

There are three solutions to remedy this and allow the program to work:
1) The most simple solution is to download the complete application from my Github Repository. This features all required folders and can be found at: https://github.com/GooseAye/MastersProject
2) Navigate to the above described file paths on the command line, and enter the command "npm install", which should install all of the development dependencies.
3) Download the above three folders directly from my Google Drive. 

Unfortunately, the direct upload of all of these files to Moodle was not possible.
